# Food Management System Using JAVA

This is a console-based Java application developed in IntelliJ IDEA that simulates a simple food ordering and inventory 
system. It supports two types of users: Admin and Customer. Admins can add new food items, update prices, and manage the 
inventory, while customers can view available food items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout. 
The project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles, user role handling, and menu-driven interactions.

## **Run the Code**
Go to "Food-management-system-JAVA/src"
```bash
    cd "Food-management-system-JAVA/src"
```

The **Main.java** file is present inside that folder. That is the only executable file. Run that file in your IDE.

## **NOTE**
 - Use Intellij IDE
